A public member is accessible from anywhere outside the class but within a program. You can set and get the value of public variables without any member.

A private member variable or function cannot be accessed, or even viewed from outside the class. Only the class and **friend functions** can access private members.

A protected member variable or function is very similar to a private member but it provided one additional benefit that they can be accessed in **child classes** which are called derived classes.
